# Arcmap-Add-in-Extension
It is the repo where the codes I developed with arcpy are located.
Add-in Extension Content:
• **When a new box is created, empty latitude/longitude is filled.
• When you click save in the editor, if there is an empty record in the network name column in the station table, excluding SDKs, a pop-up will be launched with its objectid.
• If the position of a selected box in the Kofra layer changes, the latitude/longitude columns will be updated instantly.
* In addition, an improvement has been made in which incorrect stations are selected during the save.
  The purpose of this development; It is possible to directly access the selected objects through the geonis form.
